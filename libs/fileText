The fax machine is a very convenient aid to contact companies and friends
because messages are transmitted immediately.
Fax machines work like photocopiers. They make a copy of a document and
then send it down a telephone line to another fax machine. In this  way
they can send and receive information from each other. You can send any
kind of thigs by fax, but it is more expensive than e-mail.
